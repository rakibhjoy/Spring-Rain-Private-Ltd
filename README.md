#### Agile
Client is always involved in the development process. It is a continuous process. It is a flexible process. It is a fast process. It is a cost-effective process.

Agile has four main point

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools ( Discuss about what you did and what you are going to do and who is blocked for you)

- A CI/CD pipeline is maintained in DevOps.
- Integration works with sonarqube , unit test, code coverage, etc.
